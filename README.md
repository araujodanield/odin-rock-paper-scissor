# Rock Paper Scissors Game
Third project of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a>'s course.

This is a two-versions project of a rock paper scissors game to practice the use of multiple functions and DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

### <a href="https://araujodanield.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/" target="_blank">You can look the page and play the game clicking here!</a>

</br>

## Console Version
 In this first version of the project the game is meant to be  played totally on your browser's console. You'll play five rounds against the machine.

 ### How to Play:
 1. With the game homepage open, press <code>Ctrl + Shift + i</code> on your keyboard, this will open the Console panel of DevTools;

 2. Click on the white space, write "<code>game()</code>" and press <code>Enter</code>;

  - If you wants to play again after finish the five rounds or cancel the game, you can just press <code>UpArrow ↑ + Enter</code> in your keyboard and this will start the game without need of write the function again;

  - If you want to clear your previous rounds, write "<code>clear()</code>" and press <code>Enter</code>, or press the clear button on the console panel.

</br>

## Interactive Version
 In this version, the rules are a little different. Instead of playing just five rounds, here you'll be playing unlimited rounds until you or the machine scores 5 points.

 ### How to Play:
 - When you open the page, you will see three buttons, representing yours options;
 - Click on any of them and the game will start;
 - When someone gets 5 points, the game will end and an overlay announcing the winner will appear along with a "Play Again" button which, if clicked, will restart the game.

## Project's next steps:
- Change the design of the page to look more like a game;
- Add background music and sound effects (with the option to turn them off);
- Try to refactor some parts of the code;
- Change this README file to make it more visual.
